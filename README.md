# Monte-Carlo-Pi-Approximation

This project contains a script for approximating the value of Pi using a Monte Carlo simulation. The script uses the Tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to run the simulation with a specified number of darts and see the results visually.

## Files

- `monte_carlo_pi_approximation.py`: The main script to run the Monte Carlo Pi approximation simulation.

## Description

The `monte_carlo_pi_approximation.py` script uses the Tkinter library to create a GUI for running a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the value of Pi. Users can specify the number of darts to throw and whether to animate the simulation. The results are displayed on a canvas, and the estimated value of Pi is shown in a text box.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed on your system:

- `tkinter`
- `math`
- `random`
- `time`

You can install them using `pip`:

```sh
pip install tkinter
